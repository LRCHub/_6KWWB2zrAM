You guys do not notice
That we are gifted just by being humans
We are absolute predators
We do not even have any enemies
Maybe there are other animals watching us
And thinking that "someday we will beat them down!"

Oh, we have the brains to think hard
Wear our favorite clothes
We are at no doubt human beings
Many small lives
They were born (They were born)
With the fate (with the fate) of dying for someone
(For someone, a human baby)
A human baby when will they find out
(When will they find out the true fact, yeah)
That at the point they were born, we are
(We are winners)
The winners of Earth

Aa hitori naiteita tonari no kimi ga toikakeru
Dakara bokura yorisoi ikiru kirameku made

For what have I been living for?
When will I find out the answer?
An answer that is only for you
What will myself and the first scenery I saw look like?
It's my face, my face

Shut up!
I read this inside the book I read before
(The book I read before)
According to Maslow
(According to Maslow)
There are five steps (in a) human's desire

To live a long life to stay safe and to receive
(Baby) love from others
To get respect from (Baby) other
To get closer (Yeah) to your ideal (Yeah)
That's what it said
(Yeah) No matter how hard other animals try
They probably can't go over the first step
That is how intelligent we are and an animal filled with greed
But that is probably why we can still live on top of the food chain
In this blue planet although we have weak bodies

Aa mata kimi no me ni itsumo no asa ga utsurikomu
Nagareru namida ga kieteyuku

For what to live for
Think deeply as you live yeah...
Cuz humans are the only ones that can do this on Earth
Atarashii kotae wo
What is it that you want to get in your right hands?
Let me hear

Tell me your new answer
Prove that you are different from monkeys
If there is nothing to crave for, humans will die in a way
Don't you think so too?
Let me hear, let me hear, let me hear
