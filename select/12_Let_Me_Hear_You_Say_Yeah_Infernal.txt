Let Me Hear You Say"
(Feat. Nitty)

Oh! Let me hear you say
Oh! Everybody say
Oh! Let it take control,
Say OH! All my people say
Oh! Everybody say
Oh! Let it take control
Let me hear you say

On a Friday night, there's nothing better
Than letting go, and chilling with my girlfriends
Head to the club, and tell the DJ
To play my song, and get the party jumping

When we hit the floor, it fills my body
Deep in my soul, I can feel it
Been waiting all night long, to get my party on
Come on and play my song so every one can say

I see this guy, and he's trying,
To make a move, but thats not what I'm here for boy
I got a man at home, and I love him
But it's my night out and I'm chilling with my girlfriends

It's been a while since we hit the town
Me and my girls we just wanna get down
We grab a drink, feel the beat, hit the street
And we're heading to another party
