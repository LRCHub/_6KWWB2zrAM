[00:00.45] You guys do not notice that we
[00:04.06] Are gifted just by being humans
[00:06.85] We are absolute predators
[00:09.95] We do not even
[00:11.88] Have any enemies
[00:14.02] Maybe there are other animals watching us
[00:17.52] And thinking that "Someday we will beat them down"
[00:42.52] 
[00:32.34] Oh, we have the brains to think hard
[00:35.18] Wear our favorite clothes
[00:37.93] We are at no doubt human beings
[00:41.80] Many small lives
[00:49.80] 
[00:43.22] They were born (they were born)
[00:45.03] With the fate (with the fate)
[00:46.58] Of dying for someone (for someone a human baby)
[00:49.77] A human baby
[00:51.65] When will they find out? (When will they find out the true fact? Yeah)
[00:55.39] That at the point they were born, we are (we are winners)
[00:59.03] (The) winners of Earth
[01:10.03] 
[01:01.87] ああ、一人泣いていた隣の君が問いかける
[01:13.36] だから僕ら寄り添い生きるきらめくまで
[01:22.36] 
[01:20.95] For what have I been living for?
[01:22.43] When will I find out the answer?
[01:23.75] An answer that is only for you
[01:25.94] What will myself and (the) first scenery I saw look like?
[01:33.40] It's my face, my face
[01:43.90] 
[01:39.96] Shut up! I read this inside
[01:43.77] The book I read before (the book I read before)
[01:46.21] According (to) Maslow (according (to) Maslow)
[01:48.28] There are five steps (in a) human's desire
[02:09.28] 
[01:51.15] To live a long long life to stay safe and to receive (baby)
[01:55.01] Love from others
[01:57.53] To get respect from (baby)
[01:59.51] Others, to get closer (yeah)
[02:00.97] To your ideal (yeah)
[02:02.89] That's what it said (yeah)
[02:15.89] 
[02:05.09] No matter how hard other animals try
[02:08.69] They probably can't go over the first step
[02:11.92] That is how intelligent we are and, (an animal) filled with greed
[02:44.42] 
[02:24.64] But that is probably why we can still live
[02:28.28] On the top of the food chain
[02:30.26] In this blue planet although we have weak bodies
[02:54.26] 
[02:34.94] ああ、また君の目にいつもの朝が映り込む
[02:45.50] 流れる涙が消えてゆく
[02:50.50] 
[02:51.89] For what to live for
[02:54.82] Think deeply as you live, yeah
[02:58.68] 'Cause you humans are (the) only ones that can do this on Earth
[03:03.65] 新しい答えを
[03:09.82] What is it that you want to get in your right hands?
[03:13.91] Let me hear
[03:19.41] 
[03:16.92] Tell me your new answer
[03:17.89] Prove that you are different from monkeys
[03:19.27] If there is nothing to crave for, humans will die in a way don't you think so too?
[03:24.75] Let me hear, let me hear, let me hear
